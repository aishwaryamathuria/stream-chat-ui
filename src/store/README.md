# Store Folder

This folder contains Redux store configuration, slices, and state management logic.

## What goes here:
- **Store configuration** - Redux store setup
- **Redux slices** - Feature-specific state slices
- **Reducers** - State update logic
- **Actions** - Action creators and thunks
- **Selectors** - State selection functions

## Best practices:
- Use Redux Toolkit for modern Redux
- Create separate slices for different features
- Use createAsyncThunk for async operations
- Keep state normalized and flat
- Use selectors for complex state access
