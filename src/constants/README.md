# Constants Folder

This folder contains constant values that are used throughout the application.

## What goes here:
- **Application constants** - Values that don't change
- **Configuration values** - App configuration settings
- **Enum-like objects** - Fixed sets of values
- **Magic numbers** - Numeric constants with meaning

## Best practices:
- Use descriptive names in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Group related constants together
- Export constants for easy importing
- Document what each constant represents
- Avoid hardcoding values in components
