# Components Folder

This folder contains reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application.

## What goes here:
- **React components** - JSX files for UI elements
- **Component styles** - CSS files specific to components
- **Component tests** - Test files for components
- **Component documentation** - Storybook stories or docs

## Best practices:
- One component per file
- Use descriptive, PascalCase names
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Include both JSX and CSS files for each component
- Make components reusable and configurable with props

## What NOT to put here:
- Pages or routes (that goes in pages/ or routes/)
- Business logic (that goes in services/)
- State management (that goes in store/)
