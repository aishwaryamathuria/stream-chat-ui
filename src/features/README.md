## What goes here:
- **Feature components** - Components specific to a business feature
- **Feature logic** - Business logic for specific features
- **Feature tests** - Tests for feature functionality
- **Feature documentation** - Feature-specific documentation

## Best practices:

- Use clear, business-focused naming
