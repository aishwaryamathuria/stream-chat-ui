# Chat Feature Folder

This folder contains all components and logic specific to the chat functionality.

## What goes here:
- **Chat components** - Components specific to chat functionality
- **Chat logic** - Business logic for chat features
- **Chat utilities** - Helper functions for chat operations
- **Chat tests** - Tests for chat functionality

## Best practices:
- Keep all chat-related code in this folder
- Make components reusable within the chat feature
- Separate UI components from business logic
- Include proper error handling for chat operations
- Consider real-time messaging requirements

## What NOT to put here:
- General UI components (that goes in src/components/)
- App-wide state management (that goes in src/store/)
- General utilities (that goes in src/utils/)
