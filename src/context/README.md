# Context Folder

This folder contains React Context providers for sharing state across the application.

## What goes here:
- **Context providers** - React Context setup and providers
- **Context hooks** - Custom hooks for using contexts
- **Global state contexts** - App-wide state management

## Best practices:
- Create separate contexts for different concerns
- Use custom hooks to consume contexts
- Keep context providers focused on specific functionality
- Consider using Redux for complex state management instead
